/**
 * <div class="javadoc-text">An instance of the <b>Mediator</b> pattern,
 * described in <i>Design Patterns</i> [{@linkplain GangOfFour Gang of Four}],
 * pp. 273-282. Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects
 * interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring
 * to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction
 * independently.
 * <p/>
 * A Mediator is like the moderator in a chat room. In the example here, the
 * Mediator acts like Control Central, to coordinate different widgets in a Font
 * Select dialog. The UML Diagram appears below. See also the
 * {@linkplain gof.designpatterns.structures.MediatorStructure Mediator
 * Structure} diagram.</div>
