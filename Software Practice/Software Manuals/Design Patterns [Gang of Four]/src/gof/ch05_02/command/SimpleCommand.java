 * <div class="javadoc-text">Adapted from Design Patterns [Gang of Four], p.
 * 240-241. Sample code to illustrate the {@linkplain gof.designpatterns.Command
 * Command} design pattern.
 * <p/>
 * Unlike the OpenCommand and the PasteCommand, this SimpleCommand has been
 * parameterized so that it can be used to construct any number of Commands. In
 * this example, the logic for five different Commands is stored in the enum
 * {@linkplain WordProcessingFunction}.
 * <p/>
 * In the manual, this is implemented as a C++ template with a pointer to a
 * function. Below, the pointer to a function is implemented with a lambda (Î»),
 * the logic stored in the WordProcessingFunction enum.</div>
