The SudokuSolver.jar file is an executable jar file. If youâ€™d like to try running it, download the jar file, and enter this on the command line: 

java -jar -Djava.security.manager SudokuSolver.jar

The puzzles the program is solving are bundled into the jar; after it completes, they are printed to the console along with the solutions. These are considered to be nine of the most difficult Sudoku puzzles in the world. Launching the jar file with the default security manager gives it the same limited permissions as the old applets running in the browser; in other words, it's secure. Feel free to contact the developer with any questions.

All the Best,
